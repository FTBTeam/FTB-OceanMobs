# FTB-OceanMobs

## Overview

FTB Ocean Mobs is a collection of dangerous amphibious mobs created for the FTB Ocean Block 2 modpack. While the mod is intended for use in that modpack, pack makers are welcome to include it in other packs if desired.

None of the mobs in this mod drop any loot by default; it is intended for pack makers to provide loot tables as required.

None of the mobs spawn naturally by default; again, it is intended for pack makers to adjust spawning rules and/or provide other means such as spawners or command blocks to spawn them.

## Requirements

- [GeckoLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib) is a required dependency
